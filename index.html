    <p>
        CoreOrate runs the emotion recognition system at the core of Orate live on your device, using your microphone to classify your speech into one of four categories -- angry, happy, neutral, and sad. Note that this is by no means a finished product -- CoreOrate is meant to be a tech demo and proof of concept only.
